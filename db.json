      "content": ["Life is a journey where we have to come across and experience different paths. Right from birth till old age, a person goes through many stages of life that we have to go through. And one of the vital stages is, “CAREER”. When we are close to reaching the ‘Career stage’ or presently standing at it we always think about it. In the morning, evening, while awake, eating, sleeping, or doing other daily chores, “one and the only” thing that we keep thinking about is “Career” and so many questions like about career? Whether this career will be good or the other one? If I choose this then will I get a good salary job in this? And so on…", "Education in any country is essential for giving momentum to the economy. India started its progression from a low base. India is fragmented in castes and languages. The work allocation is being done according to castes. All the castes could not be given equal importance in contributing to the economy’s strength. Secondly, people have been treated unequally for private jobs, no matter how much the difference in the primary conditions. The part that chained the economy in the caste system must have been over by 1991 when it was realized that the economic system could not grow up to the expectations, no matter if it continued with the same repeated practices. 1991 was the year when the wings of the economy were opened. Since then, the enrolment ratio in schools has increased manifold, and the intake capacity of higher education has increased even more. Education needs to support the economy when it is given a free path. Because the economy is expected to grow horizontally and vertically, it needs all sorts of educated people."]
